kubernetes is a greek word for helmsman or captain of a ship
kubernetes  -> k8s

k8s -> is a container management (orchestration) tool
    -> developed by google lab (& later donated to CNCF -> cloud native computive foundation)
    -> open source
    -> written in golang

container management / orchestration tool -> manages containerized application 
container management tool automates deploying, scaling and managing containerized application on a group of service


What is docker?
Example -> the developer packs the application with all its dependencies, environment variables etc in a container and now this container can be shipped using container platform (eg docker). advantages: as application as available with all its dependencies and environment variable it will work fine on all systems.
-> Thus docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers.

what are containerized application?
-> containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as on package.


Where does kubernetes come in play then?
Organizations have to use multiple containers to
Ensure availability
Load Balancing
scale up and down based on user load

Thus we have container management tool, like, kubernetes, docker swarm, apache mesos marathon

Here management involves -> deploying, scheduling, scaling, load balancing, batch execution, rollbacks, monitoring
