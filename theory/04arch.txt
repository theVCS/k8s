when we deploy kubernetes we get a cluster
a cluster is a set of machines called nodes
A cluster has atleast one worker node and atleast one master node.  


A node can be physical machine, virtual machine, VM on cloud

Inside node we have pods, inside a pod we can have one container 




4 Components of master node
3 Components of worker node
Addons
How master and worker interact




Mater node
responsible for managing the cluster
monitors nodes and pods in a cluster
When a node fails move the workload of the failed node to another worker node

4 components of master node
-> api server (JSON over HTTP)
-> scheduler (schedules pods on nodes)
-> controller manager (runs controller)
-> etcd ()

apis -> allow applications to communicate with one another. It is the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane
Exposes API for almost every operation
The users, management devices, and command line interfaces all talk to the API server to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.


scheduler pods across multiple nodes
Components on the master that watches newly created pods that have no node assigned, and selects a node for them to run on
The scheduler obtains from etcd, via the API server, resource usage data for each worker node in cluster
scheduler gets the information for the hardware configuaration from configuration file and schedules the pods on nodes accordingly


Control Manager -> This is a component on the master that runs controller 
The cloud controller manager runs controllers reponsible to interact with the underlying infrastructure of a cloud provider when nodes become unavailable,  to manage storage volumes when provided by cloud service, and to manage load balancing and routing.
Kube-controller-manager-> node controller, replication controller, endpoints controller, service account and token controller
